	"news2_4": "最近閱讀一些傑克‧威爾許（Jack Welch, 1935-2020）的資料，他被譽為「世紀經理人」、「全球第一CEO」「美國當代最成功、最偉大的企業家」。1981 年開始執掌「通用電氣」（GE, General Electric）的 20 年間，公司市值從 130 億美元激增至 4,000 億美元，成為全球市值最高的公司之一。威爾許的成功智慧是「人才造就偉大的企業」、「人才是策略的第一個步驟」、「在你成為領導人之前，成功是使自己成長；成為領導人之後，成功是讓他人成長」。常言道：「人對了，事就對了。」威爾許曾說：「他花70%的時間在找「對的人」，這培育人才的過程包括：發掘、考核、培養人才。",
	"news2_5": "誠然，人才與企業的成敗兩者之間的關係是息息相關，任何經營有成果的優良企業，皆是重視並徹底實踐「選才、用才、育才、留才」哲學的企業。今天教會是否看重人才？是否願意投放資源積極「選才、用才、育才、留才」呢？",
	"news2_6": "《祈禱出來的能力》一書作者邦茲 (E.M. Bounds)曾說：「教會正不斷探求更好的方法，但是，神卻不斷尋找敬虔的人。」(The church is looking for better methods, but God is looking for better men.) 對神而言，更好的人比更好的方法是更加重要，這個優先次序是不可顛倒的。因為方法本身是不能自動運作的，乃是需要有合適的人；擁有屬靈美德和靈性成熟的人去運用它，方法才能產生事半功倍的屬靈果效。",
	"news2_7": "因此，選「對的人」不是源於企業家成功的智慧，乃是上帝自古以來歷久不變的心意：尋找、訓練和使用合衪心意的人，如摩西、約書亞、大衛、保羅…等。主耶穌也揀選和訓練一羣合適的門徒，他們是樂意順從大使命，訓練別人成為合適門徒的人。今天，我們需要按上帝的心意，效法基督的榜樣，看重尋找、訓練和建立人。教會需要裝備優秀的人才，彼此配搭，「為要成全聖徒，各盡其職，建立基督的身體」(弗 4:12)，榮耀上帝。",
