	"news2_5": "主啊，感謝祢，不單提醒我再思「小」的重要性，祢更以身作則，活出「小」的真理。祢「本有神的形像，不以自己與神同等為強奪的；反倒虛己，取了奴僕的形像，成為人的樣式；既有人的樣子，就自己卑微，存心順服，以至於死，且死在十字架上。」(腓 2:6-8) 親愛的主，祢是至尊榮、至偉大的上帝，然而，祢卻活出至虛己、至卑微的樣式，祢曾說：「人子來，並不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，並且要捨命作多人的贖價。」(可10:45) 祢的言談身教幫助我，更深體會事奉不是要爭上位、爭做大，乃是效法祢的榜樣，甘願付出、犧牲和愛去服事更多的人。祢的腳踪何等佳美，我願跟隨祢腳踪行，一生學做小小的僕人，總叫袮在我身上照常顯大，祢必興旺，我必衰微。",
